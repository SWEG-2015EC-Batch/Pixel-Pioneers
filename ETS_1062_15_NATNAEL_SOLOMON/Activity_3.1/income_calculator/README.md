## Problem Analysis

### Input 
The program takes the following inputs:
1. **weeklyhours**: The number of hours worked in a week.
2. **gross_salary**: The gross salary earned.
3. **overtimebonusrate_perhour**: The overtime bonus rate per hour, if applicable.

### Process 
1. The program calculates the overtime payment if the weekly hours worked exceed 40 hours.
